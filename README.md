# RSS-News-Reader-Application-with-Voice-Output
This is an *android application* to extract RSS feeds and display it in a application.
I have used the Rss feed of a popular news and have uses native android classes to pull this information and display is as a list view in the application.

[Rss Reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=4XYVLKf2Ljs&feature=emb_title) displays a simple [ListView](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_list_view.htm) class of Android, consists of JSON data pulled from a 
RSS Feed.
**I have used Android's _[TexttoSpeech](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech)_ to read all the elements of the listview i.e. the extracted JSON data.**
